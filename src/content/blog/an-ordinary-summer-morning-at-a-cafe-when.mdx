I saw a fire consume her face <br></br>
tear through her tall cheekbones <br></br>
and burn what remained of her innocuous past <br></br>

vedas fanned the flames <br></br>
that weaved around her ears <br></br>
braids of hair sparked just as fast <br></br>

the sun perched over the minarets of her mind <br></br>
clothes peeled off designer skin <br></br>
red blisters caught wind of my horror <br></br>
erupting the colour off skies behind

she kept reciting the hymns that roasted her breath <br></br>
even as melting jaws opposed her cause <br></br>
I yelled, rained a storm at her <br></br>
only for the hoses to calm to a pause <br></br>

dense smoke billowed out of her nostrils <br></br>
chakra glowed orange, red then black <br></br>
the vast scorched valleys of her silent fears <br></br>
had claimed her visage their place <br></br>

last of father's tears dried on her lips <br></br>
laden with lipstick and a tinge of detest <br></br>
begging her to halt, for they had forgiven <br></br>
and that the world had been laid to rest <br></br>

but the sati of her blue dowry dreams <br></br>
screamed of suffer, rage <br></br>
drenched in blood of the devil's caste <br></br>
she had her soul spilled over the altar <br></br>

midnight's lunch lurched out of her mouth <br></br>
raced down her bones and charred toenails <br></br>
distant wails of the fire brigade <br></br>
sweeped through the shadows as she fell<br></br>

I saw a fire devour her <br></br>
nurture her, embrace her <br></br>
fondle her with immense passion <br></br>
and long before the crime <br></br>
when I meet my fate <br></br>
she will have killed fate herself <br></br>
