Imbalances are ubiquitous in nature. Their very existence is a macrocosm of bizarre phenomena 
that react in wild and seemingly unpredictable ways.
But mathematicians, the smartest and inquisitive of all humans, devised a way to reify these imbalances into a formal system
that always hold true. Several abstract and difficult problems have been reduced to
trivial solutions through a series of logical consequences that arise from inequalities. And much to the irony,
we need these inequalities to prove equalities of all kinds.

Please bear in mind that over the course of this article, I will not go over the proofs of these inequalities
to avoid making this a verbose mathematical discourse! I plan on keeping this extremely
comprehensible and intuitive with a greater on focus on their practicality, but I certainly do not mind
expanding on examples to help clear the picture for you.

## The Mean Triplet

I consider the Mean-Triplet, more commonly known as the Arithmetic Mean(AM) - Geometric Mean(GM) - Harmonic Mean(HM)
inequality, as the father of all inequalites. It is very fundamental and finds tremendous applications in
everyday scenarios.

_It states that for any non-negative real number, their AM is greater than their GM, which is in turn greater
than their HM, with equality only when all values are equal._

Mathematically,

$$
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 \times a_2 \times \dots \times a_n} \geq
\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_n}}
$$

The AM-GM relationship is often used to maximize or minimize functions. The AM is simple and applies equal
weight to every value when calculating the mean. The Geometric mean, on the other hand, is used to capture
the averaging of compounding effects. 

To illustrate this, let us consider the annual returns of an investment
for $$ 3 $$ years to be $$ 5\% $$, $$ 8\% $$, and $$ 6\% $$ respectively. The formula for the average growth
rate for the period is given by

$$

(\prod_{i=n}^{n}(1 + n_i))^\frac{1}{n} - 1


$$

where $$ n_i $$ represents the return for the $$ ith $$ period and $$ n $$ is the total number of periods.
We need not really bother ourselves with the intricacies of this equation to understand the Geometric Mean
but unfortunately, I love explaining.

The $$ (1 + n_i) $$ term is called the growth factor. We can arrive at this quite easily when we look at the
formula for fractional (or percent) change.

$$

\frac{final - initial}{initial} = change


$$

$$

\frac{final}{initial} = 1 + change


$$

Evidently, the growth factor is simply the ratio of final and initial values, or $$ 1 $$ plus the fractional change.
The significance of this lies in the fact that adding $$ 1 $$ accounts for the initial value as well as the growth
rate. Here's an example. Say an investment has grown by $$ 12\% $$ (growth rate) in the past year.
This means that the fractional increase is $$ 0.12 $$ times the initial investment. The $$ 1 $$ in $$ 1 + 0.12 $$
includes the original investment. If we multiply $$ 1.12 $$ with the initial, we get the final return. We can
also say that the final value is $$ 112\% $$ of the initial value. Similarly, if we incur a negative growth rate (loss) of say $$ 5\% $$, the growth factor
would be $$ 1 + (-0.05) = 0.95 $$, meaning the final value is $$ 95\% $$ of the original.

Now, multiplying all the growth factors gives us the total growth over all periods combined. And then taking
its geometric mean averages the total growth over the entire period. This is important because unlike the
AM, the GM successfully accounts for the compounding of each return in successive years. We then subtract 1
from this average to convert it to a percentage. But how did that work? If you noticed, the geometric mean of
the total growth is the growth factor. In our previous examples, a growth factor of 1.12 gives us a
$$ 1.12 - 1 = 0.12 $$ growth rate and a growth factor of 0.95 gives us a $$ 0.95 - 1 = -0.05 $$ growth rate
respectively. This shows that subtracting 1 from the growth factor gives us the percentage increase (or decrease) in our investment. With
all of that away, the final average growth rate in our case would be,

$$

((1 + 0.05)(1 + 0.08)(1 + 0.06))^\frac{1}{3} - 1 = 1.0629 - 1 = 0.0629 = 6.29\%


$$

Taking the Arithmetic Mean would simply result in

$$

\frac{5\% + 8\% + 6\%}{3} = 6.33\%


$$

which isn't quite accurate. Note that the AM is always greater than the GM. The GM is more
accurate in averaging rates with data whose relationships are multiplicative or proportional in nature, as in our
case.

Additionally, we can also include the Quadratic Mean (QM, also known as the Root Mean Square), which applies a greater
weight to the larger values and is often used in averaging varying quantities like AC current and voltage or
measuring errors in statistics.

$$
\sqrt{\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2}{n}} \geq AM


$$

Like the GM, the Harmonic mean is also useful when averaging rates. It is used in finance to calculate
analysis metrics like Price-to-Earnings ratio, or in electrical engineering to calculate the
equivalent resistance of resistors connected in parallel.
Contrary to the Quadratic Mean, which assigns a greater weight to the larger values in the set, the HM punishes the
central tendency by applying a greater weight to the lower values.
This means that greater the extremes in a series of values, the lower the Harmonic Mean. This is because HM relies on the reciprocals of each value. The smaller the value, the
larger is its reciprocal, and consequently, the greater its influence in shifting the mean towards itself.
But it obviously cannot be calculated if any of the values is zero, since the reciprocal of zero
does not exist.

The simplest example of the Harmonic Mean can be found while averaging speeds.
Consider a car moving at $$ 20 $$km/h for $$ 10 $$km and $$ 40 $$km/h for another $$10$$km. If we take the AM of the speeds, we'd get
$$ 30 $$km/h. But we know that average speed is equal
to $$ \frac{total distance}{total time} $$. If we now calculate the average speed, we get $$ 26.66 $$ which is equal
to the HM of the speeds and not the AM.

$$

\frac{20}{\frac{10}{20} + \frac{10}{40}} = 26.66 = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{40}}


$$

Why does this work? It is because the harmonic mean of speeds is weighted by time and not by distance. Speed is inversely
related to time. Hence, the time we spend at a particular speed must affect the overall average speed. The slower
the speed, the greater is the time spent at that speed and the greater its impact in the average. The AM
assumes that each speed is equally weighted, but what matters is not just the speed itself but the
time spent at each speed. The HM is correct in applying greater weight to the the lower speeds.

## The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

The Cauchy-Schwarz is perhaps the most brilliant inequality with far-reaching implications in all of mathematics.

_It states that for any two sets of real numbers $$ A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\} $$ and $$ B = \{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\} $$,
the product of the sum of the squares of each number in both sets, is greater than or equal to the square of the
sum of the product of corresponding values of each set._

$$

(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2


$$

with the equality holding iff

$$

\frac{a_1}{b_1} = \frac{a_2}{b_2} = \dots = \frac{a_n}{b_n}


$$

A corollary definition of this inequality can be found in Vector Calculus, where it provides an upper bound for
the for any two vectors $$ \vec{v} $$ and $$ \vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}^n $$

$$

\|\vec{v}\| \|\vec{u}\| \geq |\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u}|


$$

where $$ \|\vec{v}\| $$ and $$ \|\vec{v}\| $$ are the norms of the vectors
and $$ | \vec{u} \cdot \vec{u} | $$ is the absolute value of their dot product,
with equality holding iff the vectors are linearly dependent 
or one of the vectors is a null vector. A set of vectors are linearly dependent when
at least one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors
(There exists a scalar $$ a $$ which satisfies $$ \vec{v} = a\vec{u} $$).

The inequality provides an upper bound for the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors.
Specifically, it states that the absolute value of the dot product cannot exceed the product
of the magnitudes of the two vectors. Norm is just a fancy word used to describe the magnitude or length of
the vector (in Euclidean space). By expanding the modulus of the inquality, we can determine the range
of the dot product.

$$

- \|\vec{v}\| \|\vec{u}\| \leq \vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} \leq \|\vec{v}\| \|\vec{u}\|

$$

For the sake of simplicity, I am considering the vectors to be in real space $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$. But the
inequality can be generalized, 
and holds true in non-Euclidean vector spaces with complex forms. The dot product is just a special
case of the inner product in $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$ space.

The applications of Cauchy-Schwarz can be seen when we take the cosine of the angle between two vectors

$$

\cos\theta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u}}{\|\vec{v}\| \|\vec{v}\|}


$$

or in the covariance inequality in probability theory

$$

Var(X)Var(Y) \geq Cov(X, Y)^2


$$

where $$ X $$ and $$ Y $$ are two random variables $$ Var $$ and $$ Cov $$ are their variance and covariance.
It also gives rise to an inequality known as Titu's Lemma, which is of the form

$$


\frac{a_1^2}{b_1} + \frac{a_2^2}{b_2} + \dots + \frac{a_n^2}{b_n} \geq \frac{(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)^2}{b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_n}


$$

This is often used as a shortcut for solving inequalities whose numerators are perfect squares.

## The Rearrangement Inequality

If you're familiar with greedy algorithms in computer science, this is exactly what it is.

_It states that for any two sets of monotonically increasing real numbers $$ A = \{ a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \dots \leq a_n \} $$
and $$ B = \{ b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \dots \leq b_n \} $$, the value of $$ a_1'b_1' + a_2'b_2' + \dots + a_n'b_n' $$, where $$ a_n' $$ and $$ b_n' $$
denotes the nth value in any random permutation of both the sets, is maximised and minimised when_

$$

a_nb_n + a_{n-1}b_{n-1} + a_1b_1 \geq a_1'b_1' + a_2'b_2' + \dots + a_n'b_n' \geq a_nb_1 + a_{n-1}b_2 + \dots + a_1b_n


$$

_with equality when the values of one or both sets are equal._

If the above notation looks a little cumbersome, here's a breakdown of the inequality through an example.
Consider three bags of $$ 10 $$ rupee, $$ 20 $$ rupee and $$ 50 $$ rupee notes, each containing $$ 3 $$ notes each.
If we are asked to get the maximum amount by picking $$ 5 $$ notes in total, we would obviously pick $$ 3 $$ notes from the $$ 50 $$
rupee bag, $$ 2 $$ from the $$ 20 $$, and none from the $$ 10 $$ rupee bag. This conclusion is simply common sense. Similarly,
if we are asked to get the minimum, we'd pick three $$ 10 $$ rupee and two $$ 20 $$ rupee notes. The rearrangement inequality
illustrates this exact "greedy" logic. Any other permutation (or grouping) of the notes, with the given constraint
of 5 notes, would result in a value
that lies between the two.

This consequently leads us to another famous inequality known as Chebyshev's inequality.

$$

n(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)(b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_n)


$$

but when the sequences are oppositely oriented, say $$ B = \{b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \dots \geq b_n \} $$

$$

n(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n) \leq (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)(b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_n)


$$

In both the cases, equality is achieved when the sequences are constant. The impact of Chebyshev's Inequality
is widely felt in probability theory. It provides an upper bound on the probability that a random variable
(say $$ X $$) deviates from its mean by more than a definite amount of standard deviations. 

$$

P(|X - \mu| \geq n\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{n^2}

$$

where $$ \mu $$ is the mean, $$ \sigma $$ is the SD and $$ n $$ is the number of SD. 
This bound is not definitive but only a
conservative estimate which works well for most cases, regardless of the type of distribution. 
Due to this, it is popular in many statistical 
inferences. Let's take an example. 

The mean ($$ \mu $$) of the subject score for a group of students is $$ 60 $$ and the standard deviation is 
$$ 15 $$. If we randomly pick a student, what is the probability that the student has a score which is greater
than $$ 30 $$ but less than $$ 90 $$? 

There are other ways to arrive at the right answer, but we'll stick to using Chebyshev. Let's first calculate the $$ n $$ (also the z-score), which gives us the 
number of standard deviations above or below the mean. In this case, $$ \frac{60 - 30}{15} = \frac{90 - 60}{15} = 2 $$.
If the values of n were not equal, we would settle with the greater z-score (we are only concerned about the magnitude and not sign).
We now need $$ P(|X - \mu| < 2) $$, which is equal to  $$ 1 - P(|X - \mu| \geq 2) $$. Therefore

$$

P(|X - \mu| < 2) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{n^2}


$$

$$

P(|X - \mu| < 2) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{4} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

$$

This shows that there is at least a $$ 75\% $$ chance that a randomly chosen student has a score between $$ 30 $$ and 
$$ 90 $$.

## Jensen's Inequality

This is an extremely powerful inequality (and probably my favourite of all).
To understand Jensen's inequality, let us first explore convex and concave functions.

A function is convex (also concave up) if the second derivative, $$ f''(x) \geq 0 $$ and concave (also concave down) 
if $$ f''(x) \leq 0 $$ for all $$ x \in \mathbb{R} $$. If $$ f''(x) = 0 $$, the point is an inflection point where
the function's concavity (or convexity) changes.
Further, the sign of the first derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing in the
said interval.

![Concavity](/concavity.webp)

_Now, the inequality states that if $$ f(x) $$ is convex in the interval $$ [a, b] $$, then_ 

$$

f(\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n}) \leq \frac{f(a_1) + f(a_2) + \dots + f(a_n)}{n}


$$

_and if it is concave, the reverse inequality holds true $$ \forall x \in [a, b] $$_

The simplest application of this inequality can be demonstrated by proving the AM-GM inequality.
Let us consider a function $$ f(x) = -log(x) $$, whose graph looks like this. It is simply the reflection 
of $$ log(x) $$ against the x-axis.
![Log](/log.webp)

The first derivative of this function is $$ f'(x) = -\frac{1}{x} $$, and its second derivative 
$$ f''(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} $$. Since $$ f''(x) > 0 $$ for all $$ x \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\} $$,
$$ f(x) $$ is concave up for $$ x > 0 $$. Thus, by using the inequality, 

$$

-log(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}) \leq \frac{-(log(x_1) + log(x_2) + \dots + log(x_n))}{n}


$$

$$

log(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}) \geq \frac{log(x_1) + log(x_2) + \dots + log(x_n)}{n}

$$

When we multiply both sides of an inequality by $$ -1 $$, the inequality reverses. 
If you remember your properties of logarithm, you'll likely remember these two rules.

$$

log_{a^n}(b)^m = \frac{m}{n}log_a(b)


$$

$$

log_a(b) = \frac{log_x{b}}{log_x{a}}


$$

Our goal is to raise the numerator to a fraction $$ \frac{1}{n} $$, since we need to obtain the 
Geometric Mean, which is a surd.
If we do this, we have to compensate by raising the power of the base to the same fraction, by following
rule 1. Similarly, for the denominator, we know $$ log_{e^1/n}(e) = n \times log_e(e) = n $$ as $$ log(e) = 1 $$.

$$

LHS \geq \frac{log_{e^1/n}(x_1 x_2 \dots x_n)^\frac{1}{n}}{log_{e^1/n}(e)}


$$

Now, applying the second rule to this inequality, we can replace the fraction with a logarithm whose base is the
argument of the denominator ($$ e $$ in this case) and its argument the numerator. Hence, we get

$$

log_e(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}) \geq log_e({(x_1 x_2 \dots x_n)^\frac{1}{n}})


$$

Since the base of the logarithms on both sides are $$ e $$, which is greater than 1, we can remove the function
and simply apply the inequality to its arguments.

$$

\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} \geq (x_1 x_2 \dots x_n)^\frac{1}{n}


$$

> if $$ log_a(x) > log_a(y) $$, then
> $$ x > y $$ when $$ a > 1 $$ and
> $$ x < y $$ when $$ 0 < a < 1 $$

This proves the AM-GM inequality. Isn't it remarkable?

## Bonus: The Chicken-McNugget Theorem

This has to be my favourite little theorem of all time, not just for its fancy name, but for good reason.
It states that
_for any two co-prime numbers $$ a $$ and $$ b $$, the greatest integer that cannot be written as a linear_
_combination of a and b $$ (ax + by) $$ is $$ mn - m - n $$._ Let's illustrate this with an example.

Consider a game that awards $$ 7 $$ points and $$ 11 $$ points to a player on the basis of various scenarios. Since, $$ 7 $$
and 11 are co-prime, we can apply the McNugget theorem and find that $$ 59 $$, which is $$(7 \times 11 - 7 - 11) $$,
is the maximum amount of points that cannot be scored by any player. Thus, scoring $$ 59 $$ points is an impossibility
for any player playing the game. After $$ 59 $$ points, every point is possible as they can be represented as 
a linear combination of $$ 7 $$ and $$ 11 $$. 

$$
  60 = 7 \times 7 + 11 \times 1
$$
$$
  61 = 7 \times 4 + 11 \times 3
$$
$$
  62 = 7 \times 1 + 11 \times 5
$$

Of course, smaller impossible scores like 10, 20, etc. exist, but are of trivial concern.

## Conclusion

Mathematics was my top subject throughout school. I probably owe it to my dad, who has a masters in Pure Mathematics,
for impressing me early in my childhood.
Although I barely participated in rigorous
maths competitions and cannot boast of any prodigious success, my fascination for the discipline has no upper-bounds. 
You can try the inequalities section in [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Inequality)
for an in-depth reference or tackle the olympiad problems if you feel up for a challenge. 

Always remember to embrace, not suppress the imbalances that wrestle inside you. They all exist for a reason.
