C is a 50 year old language. Old enough to parent us on programming languages and disappoint itself.
Despite being very relevant, it is notorious for memory-related bugs that often has disastrous
consequences. Although preventing bugs and insensible judgement are easier said than done,
even for seasoned programmers, understanding the core principles behind memory management
might just save you a grimace and a `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`.

## Understanding Memory

Pointers are variables that store the memory-address of another variable.
They allow us to access and modify data from specific memory locations,
which is extremely important for tasks that require speed, performance and robustness.

I promise we'll improve this boring textbook definition to something interesting and coherent by the end of this article.

### Value and Reference

We are aware that pointers allow us to directly manipulate the memory, but that's a rather useless statement and hardly explains
its true nature. To understand them, we must look at how variables mutation is handled.
When variables are passed to a function, most data-types are by default, passed by value. These include integers, doubles, chars and booleans.
This means that only copies of the variables are passed to the function. Modifying them inside the function only changes a local copy
of the variable, not the underlying original value stored in
the memory. Copying them does not really create extra memory overhead due to their small size.
To change their underlying value, we pass a pointer to the variable in the function, and then modify its
value by dereferencing the pointer (`*ptr`) inside the function. This is called pass by reference since the memory-address
of the variable is passed, not a copy.

```c

void changeVal(int a) {
    a = a + 1;
    printf("%d", a); // 10
}

void changeValP(int *a) {
    *a = *a + 1;
    printf("%d", *a); // 10
}

int main() {
    int num = 9;
    printf("%d", num); // 9
    changeVal(num); // 10
    printf("%d", num); // 9

    printf("%d", num); // 9
    changeValP(&num); // 10
    printf("%d", num); // 10
}

```

A common misconception is that unlike primitive types such as integer or characters, arrays in C are
passed by reference. This isn't quite true. What really happens is when an array is passed to a function, it
decays down to a pointer that points to the first element of the array. But the pointer itself is passed by
value to the function. This might all seem a bit confusing. Let's take an example.

```c

void modifyArr(int arr[], int size) {
    arr[0] = 1; // modifying content of original array

    arr = NULL; // only changes local copy of arr

    arr = malloc(sizeof(int) * size); // only changes local copy of arr
    arr[0] = 9;
    printf("%d", arr[0]); // 9
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
    modifyArr(arr, 3);
    printf("%d", arr[0]); // still prints 1
}

```

We can modify the content of the original array because we receive a pointer which points to the same memory location, but we
cannot modify the pointer itself (or the memory location it points to) since we only receive a copy of the
original pointer.

### Void and NULL Pointers

A NULL pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory location.

```c
int *ptr = NULL;

```

Dereferencing a NULL pointer is one of the most popular ways of crashing your program. It's a good practice to
always perform a nullity check before dereferencing any pointer.

```c
if (ptr != NULL) {
    // then deref
}
```

NULL pointers might seem pretty useless on the surface but as we'll learn later,
it's quite the contrary.

Void pointers are those whose types are not initialized. Therefore, they can hold any type of data
(int, bool, char, etc) but can only be dereferenced following a process known as typecasting.

```c
void *ptr;

int a = 10;
char s[] = "hello";

ptr = &a; // assign pointer to integer
printf("%d", *(int*)a); // typecast before dereferencing

ptr = s; // assign pointer to string
printf("%s", (char*)a); // typecast before dereferencing
```

On the first line in the snippet above, I declared a pointer `ptr` but did
not initialize it. This is a bad practice. The correct way would be to initialize it to NULL. But you may wonder,
what difference does this make? Won't dereferencing an uninitialized pointer and a NULL pointer both cause
errors? If so, why bother? The reason is two fold.

Firstly, uninitialized pointers hold random memory locations or garbage values. Dereferencing them may or may not
crash the program, but will certainly cause undesired behaviour that is hard to debug. NULL pointers on the other
hand, do not point to any location. And while dereferencing them will certainly crash the program, the programmer
will have better information to track and resolve the error. Secondly, we can check for nullity of a pointer
before dereferencing it, but we cannot detect whether pointer is pointing to a valid memory location or not, as
in the case of uninitialized pointers. We will discuss this further when we learn about dangling pointers.

### Arrays

Arrays in C decay to pointers. More specifically, they decay to a pointer that points to the first element of
the array. What this really means is that any array we declare can be assigned to a pointer. So while accessing
an element, we're really just dereferencing the array pointer.

```c
int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int *ptr = a; // same as int *ptr = &a[0];

printf("%d", *a); // 1;
printf("%d", a[0]); // 1;

printf("%d", *(a + 2)); // 3 (pointer arithmetic)
printf("%d", a[2]); // 3;


```

> Please be careful while performing pointer arithmetic. Going out of bounds will lead to erroneous behaviour.

The address of our array (`&a`) is used for another pointer-type called a _pointer-to-array_ type.

```c
int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int (*ptr_arr)[] = &a; // not int **ptr = &a;

printf("%d", (*ptr_arr)[2]); // 3;
```

It is important to understand that a _pointer-to-array_ is not a _pointer-to-pointer_. The address of the array
`a` in our case (`&a`), is not the address of the pointer that points to the first element of the array. Instead,
it a special _pointer-to-array_ type that points to the entire array as a unit. The address of the first element
of the array is `a` or `&a[0]`. If we need the address of the pointer that points to the first element of the array,
we would have to assign the address of `ptr` to a _pointer-to-pointer_ type.

```c
int **ptr_to_ptr = &ptr;
```

This _pointer-to-array_ type is especially helpful when dealing with multidimensional arrays in C, instead of having to work with
_pointer-to-pointers_.

```c
int matrix[][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {8, 9, 0},
};

int (*ptr)[][3]= &matrix;

printf("%d", (*ptr)[2][1]); // 9
printf("%d", (*ptr)[2][1]++); // 9
```

It is necessary to specify the inner dimension of the 2D array. This is because the compiler calculates the
address of each element using the formula

$$
    \&a[i][j] = baseAddress + (i \times cols + j) \times elementSize
$$

which is only possible when the number of columns (inner dimension) is explicitly specified.

Although an array name decays to a pointer, they are not equivalent when we compare their sizes.

```c

int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = arr;

printf("%d", sizeof(arr)); // 20, since array is of size 5 and each integer is of 4 bytes
printf("%d", sizeof(ptr)); // 4, size of the first element

```

Following this example, it is important to remember this behaviour while passing arrays to functions. When an
array is passed to a function, size of the array inside the function will only represent the size of the pointer whereas the size of
the array in its native scope will be the combined size of all its elements.

### Returning Pointers

```c
int *gimme_sum(int a, int b) {
    int c = a + b;
    return &c;
} // error!, dangling pointer

int *gimme_arr() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
    return arr;
} // error!, arr is out of scope
```

Memory of local variables are deemed invalid and reclaimed once they go out of scope, that is when the function
returns. The memory they pointed to is no longer valid and would instead create what is known as a dangling pointer.
A pointer that holds the address of an invalid memory location. Hence, using (dereferencing) this pointer would lead
to erratic behaviour, since the local variable is destroyed.

For all practical purposes, we do not really need to return pointers to primitive data-types like
integers, doubles or chars. Local copies of these variables can be returned normally from functions and used in
the outer scopes.

```c
int gimme_sum(int a, int b) {
    int c = a + b;
    return c;
}

```

Arrays however, are contiguous blocks of memory and are deemed invalid once they go out of their
original scope, as shown in the first code snippet.

There are a few ways we can return local arrays from a function. Perhaps the most straightforward way is to use
`static variables`.

Static variables in C are stored in a special memory region, separate from the heap and stack. Their memory is
preserved between function calls and remain valid throughout the lifetime of the program. This is why they do
not go out of scope when the function returns.

```c

void increment() {
  static int a = 1;
  printf("%d\n", a);
  a++;
}

int main() {
  increment(); // 1
  increment(); // 2
  increment(); // 3
}

```

Static variables allow us to return arrays like other primitive data-types.

```c
int gimme_arr() {
    static int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
    return arr; // valid
}
```

This method isn't preferred since static variables persist their state and are not thread safe,
making them difficult to manage. The answer to this is dynamic memory allocation.

```c
int *gimme_sum(int a, int b) {
    int *c = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *c = a + b;
    return c;
}

int *gimme_arr(int a, int b) {
    int *arr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    if (arr != NULL) {
        a[0] = 1;
        a[1] = 2;
        a[2] = 3;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

But we need to keep in mind that memory allocated on the heap must be freed after use to prevent the
risk of memory-leaks.

It is also considered good practice to set the freed pointer to NULL after deallocation. This is because
even after the memory is freed from the heap, the pointer still points to the memory location, albeit the memory is invalid.
To eliminate this dangling pointer, we set it to NULL for the same reasons we had discussed earlier.

### Strings

Strings in C might seem just like arrays on the surface, but are more nuanced than what meets the eye. A string
is, in fact, represented as an array of `chars` with an extra null-terminating character at the end `/0`, to denote
the end of the string. Single quotes `'` are used for characters while double quotes `"` are used for strings.
The two cannot be used interchangeably, as one might expect in languages like Python or JavaScript.
Now since strings are simply arrays, they can also be represented as pointers, as shown below.

```c

char *a = "hello";

a[0] = 'c'; // not allowed

a = "world" // allowed


```

This first type, what I like to call the _string-pointer_ type, is immutable, but can be re-assigned since its size is not known at compile time.

```c

char a[] = "hello";

a[0] = "c"; // allowed

a = "world"; // not allowed

```

In this representation, the string can be mutated but not re-assigned.

For the final variant, we have strings allocated on the heap.

```c
char *a = malloc(sizeof(char) * 6);

strcpy(a, "hello");

a[0] = "cello"; //allowed

strcpy(a, "world"); // allowed
```

This string is both mutable and re-assignable. Do note that we must use the `strcpy` from the `strings.h` library
to copy the string literal into the allocated memory block. Simply assigning it would turn it into a
_string-pointer_ type from the first example.

```c
char *a = malloc(sizeof(char) * 6);

a = "hello";  // "hello" is not allocated on the heap
```

It is also important to allocate an extra byte of memory for the null character!

### Const variables

A _pointer-to-constant_ points to a value that cannot be mutated, but the address the pointer points to
can be changed.

```c
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

const int *ptr = &a;
ptr = &b; // compiles
*ptr = 11; // error
```

Please note that `const int *ptr` and `int const *ptr` are the same! They are both _pointer-to-constants_.

A _constant-pointer_ is the opposite of a _pointer-to-constant_. We can change the value that is stored
in the address but not the address the pointer points to.

```c
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

int *const ptr = &a;
*ptr = 11; // compiles
ptr = &b; // error
```

The third type is the _constant-pointer-to-a-constant_. In this case, we are neither allowed to change
the value nor the address of the pointer.

```c
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

const int *const ptr = &a;
*ptr = 11; // error
ptr = &b; // error
```

All of this can also be said for other data-types, including structs.

## Conclusion

C is a beautiful language whose reputation is only plagued by incompetent programming.
Since introductory courses in college never do a fair job at clarifying the obfuscation around pointers,
this is a guide to avoid the pitfalls I've commonly encountered. Till next time, C ya!
