      Hey, I'm Swagatmitra. This is my blog. You're welcome to wander.

        Everything I write here is judged by a notoriously pedantic pair of eyes
        that talks, blinks and thinks like me. Usually hours after I post, it
        latches itself to this site in its quest for reasons that aggravate its
        cause. A cause that exists solely to decimate mine.
